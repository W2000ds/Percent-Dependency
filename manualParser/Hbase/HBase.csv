For example, if an HBase region server connects to a ZK ensemble that's also managed   by HBase, then the session timeout will be the one specified by this configuration.   But, a region server that connects to an ensemble managed with a different configuration   will be subjected that ensemble's maxSessionTimeout.

hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio,"For minor compaction, this ratio is used to determine whether a given StoreFile   which is larger than hbase.hstore.compaction.min.size is eligible for compaction. Its   effect is to limit compaction of large StoreFiles. The value of hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio   is expressed as a floating-point decimal. A large ratio, such as 10, will produce a single   giant StoreFile. Conversely, a low value, such as .25, will produce behavior similar to the   BigTable compaction algorithm, producing four StoreFiles. A moderate value of between 1.0 and   1.4 is recommended. When tuning this value, you are balancing write costs with read costs.   Raising the value (to something like 1.4) will have more write costs, because you will   compact larger StoreFiles. However, during reads, HBase will need to seek through fewer   StoreFiles to accomplish the read. Consider this approach if you cannot take advantage of   Bloom filters.

hbase.mob.cache.evict.remain.ratio,The ratio (between 0.0 and 1.0) of files that remains cached after an eviction   is triggered when the number of cached mob files exceeds the hbase.mob.file.cache.size.   The default value is 0.5f.,0.5f
hbase.master.mob.cleaner.period,The period that MobFileCleanerChore runs. The unit is second.   The default value is one day. The MOB file name uses only the date part of   the file creation time in it. We use this time for deciding TTL expiry of   the files. So the removal of TTL expired files might be delayed. The max   delay might be 24 hrs.,86400
hbase.mob.major.compaction.region.batch.size,"The max number of a MOB table regions that is allowed in a batch of the mob compaction. By   setting this number to a custom value, users can control the overall effect of a major   compaction of a large MOB-enabled table.   Default is 0 - means no limit - all regions of a MOB table will be compacted at once",0
hbase.mob.compaction.chore.period,The period that MobCompactionChore runs. The unit is second.   The default value is one week.,604800
hbase.snapshot.master.timeout.millis,Timeout for master for the snapshot procedure execution.,300000
hbase.snapshot.region.timeout,Timeout for regionservers to keep threads in snapshot request pool waiting.,300000
hbase.rpc.rows.warning.threshold,Number of rows in a batch operation above which a warning will be logged.,5000
hbase.master.wait.on.service.seconds,Default is 5 minutes. Make it 30 seconds for tests. See HBASE-19794 for some context.,30
hbase.master.cleaner.snapshot.interval,Snapshot Cleanup chore interval in milliseconds.   The cleanup thread keeps running at this interval   to find all snapshots that are expired based on TTL   and delete them.,1800000
hbase.master.snapshot.ttl,Default Snapshot TTL to be considered when the user does not specify TTL while   creating snapshot. Default value 0 indicates FOREVERE - snapshot should not be   automatically deleted until it is manually deleted,0
hbase.master.regions.recovery.check.interval,Regions Recovery Chore interval in milliseconds.   This chore keeps running at this interval to   find all regions with configurable max store file ref count   and reopens them.,1200000
hbase.regions.recovery.store.file.ref.count,"Very large number of ref count on a compacted   store file indicates that it is a ref leak   on that object(compacted store file).   Such files can not be removed after   it is invalidated via compaction.   Only way to recover in such scenario is to   reopen the region which can release   all resources, like the refcount,   leases, etc. This config represents Store files Ref   Count threshold value considered for reopening   regions. Any region with compacted store files   ref count > this value would be eligible for   reopening by master. Here, we get the max   refCount among all refCounts on all   compacted away store files that belong to a   particular region. Default value -1 indicates   this feature is turned off. Only positive   integer value should be provided to   enable this feature.",-1
hbase.regionserver.slowlog.ringbuffer.size,"Default size of ringbuffer to be maintained by each RegionServer in order   to store online slowlog responses. This is an in-memory ring buffer of   requests that were judged to be too slow in addition to the responseTooSlow   logging. The in-memory representation would be complete.   For more details, please look into Doc Section:   Get Slow Response Log from shell",256

hbase.regionserver.slowlog.systable.enabled,"Should be enabled only if hbase.regionserver.slowlog.buffer.enabled is enabled. If enabled   (true), all slow/large RPC logs would be persisted to system table hbase:slowlog (in addition   to in-memory ring buffer at each RegionServer). The records are stored in increasing   order of time. Operators can scan the table with various combination of ColumnValueFilter.   More details are provided in the doc section:   ""Get Slow/Large Response Logs from System table hbase:slowlog""",FALSE
hbase.rpc.rows.size.threshold.reject,"If value is true, RegionServer will abort batch requests of Put/Delete with number of rows   in a batch operation exceeding threshold defined by value of config:   hbase.rpc.rows.warning.threshold. The default value is false and hence, by default, only   warning will be logged. This config should be turned on to prevent RegionServer from serving   very large batch size of rows and this way we can improve CPU usages by discarding   too large batch request.",FALSE
hbase.namedqueue.provider.classes,Default values for NamedQueueService implementors. This comma separated full class names   represent all implementors of NamedQueueService that we would like to be invoked by   LogEvent handler service. One example of NamedQueue service is SlowLogQueueService which   is used to store slow/large RPC logs in ringbuffer at each RegionServer.   All implementors of NamedQueueService should be found under package:   "org.apache.hadoop.hbase.namequeues.impl","org.apache.hadoop.hbase.namequeues.impl.SlowLogQueueService,org.apache.hadoop.hbase.namequeues.impl.BalancerDecisionQueueService,org.apache.hadoop.hbase.namequeues.impl.BalancerRejectionQueueService"
hbase.master.balancer.decision.buffer.enabled,Indicates whether active HMaster has ring buffer running for storing   balancer decisions in FIFO manner with limited entries. The size of   the ring buffer is indicated by config: hbase.master.balancer.decision.queue.size,FALSE
hbase.master.balancer.rejection.buffer.enabled,Indicates whether active HMaster has ring buffer running for storing   balancer rejection in FIFO manner with limited entries. The size of   the ring buffer is indicated by config: hbase.master.balancer.rejection.queue.size,FALSE
hbase.locality.inputstream.derive.enabled,"If true, derive StoreFile locality metrics from the underlying DFSInputStream   backing reads for that StoreFile. This value will update as the DFSInputStream's   block locations are updated over time. Otherwise, locality is computed on StoreFile   open, and cached until the StoreFile is closed.",FALSE
hbase.locality.inputstream.derive.cache.period,"If deriving StoreFile locality metrics from the underlying DFSInputStream, how   long should the derived values be cached for. The derivation process may involve   hitting the namenode, if the DFSInputStream's block list is incomplete.",60000
