For    example, the Referer header is only present if the log message is    associated to a request and the log message happens at a time when the    Referer header has already been read from the client.  If no output is    produced, the default behavior is to delete everything from the preceding    space character to the next space character.  This means the log line is    implicitly divided into fields on non-whitespace to whitespace transitions.    If a format string item does not produce output, the whole field is    omitted.  For example, if the remote address The above behavior can be changed by adding modifiers to the format    string item. A A number as modifier can be used to assign a log severity level to a    format item. The item will only be logged if the severity of the log    message is not higher than the specified log severity level. The number can    range from 1 (alert) over 4 (warn) and 7 (debug) to 15 (trace8). For example, here's what would happen if you added modifiers to    the Some format string items accept additional parameters in braces.

KeepAlive," The Keep-Alive extension to HTTP/1.0 and the persistent    connection feature of HTTP/1.1 provide long-lived HTTP sessions    which allow multiple requests to be sent over the same TCP    connection. In some cases this has been shown to result in an    almost 50% speedup in latency times for HTML documents with    many images. To enable Keep-Alive connections, set For HTTP/1.0 clients, Keep-Alive connections will only be    used if they are specifically requested by a client. In    addition, a Keep-Alive connection with an HTTP/1.0 client can    only be used when the length of the content is known in    advance. This implies that dynamic content such as CGI output,    SSI pages, and server-generated directory listings will    generally not use Keep-Alive connections to HTTP/1.0 clients.    For HTTP/1.1 clients, persistent connections are the default    unless otherwise specified. If the client requests it, chunked    encoding will be used in order to send content of unknown    length over persistent connections. When a client uses a Keep-Alive connection, it will be counted    as a single ""request"" for the"

MergeSlashes," By default, the server merges (or collapses) multiple consecutive slash    ('/') characters in the path component of the request URL. When mapping URL's to the filesystem, these multiple slashes are not     significant.  However, URL's handled other ways, such as by CGI or proxy,    might prefer to retain the significance of multiple consecutive slashes.     In these cases When set to ""OFF"", regular expressions used in the configuration file that match    the path component of the URL ("
MergeTrailers," This directive controls whether HTTP trailers are copied into the    internal representation of HTTP headers. This merging occurs when the    request body has been completely consumed, long after most header    processing would have a chance to examine or modify request headers. This option is provided for compatibility with releases prior to 2.4.11,    where trailers were always merged."
Mutex," The The This directive only configures mutexes which have been registered    with the core server using the The following mutex This selects the default locking implementation, as determined by This effectively disables the mutex, and is only allowed for a        mutex if the module indicates that it is a valid choice.  Consult the        module documentation for more information. This is a mutex variant based on a Posix semaphore. The semaphore ownership is not recovered if a thread in the process        holding the mutex segfaults, resulting in a hang of the web server. This is a mutex variant based on a SystemV IPC semaphore. It is possible to ""leak"" SysV semaphores if processes crash        before the semaphore is removed. The semaphore API allows for a denial of service attack by any        CGIs running under the same uid as the webserver ( This selects the ""best"" available semaphore implementation, choosing        between Posix and SystemV IPC semaphores, in that order. This is a mutex variant based on cross-process Posix thread        mutexes. On most systems, if a child process terminates abnormally while        holding a mutex that uses this implementation, the server will deadlock        and stop responding to requests.  When this occurs, the server will        require a manual restart to recover. Solaris and Linux are notable exceptions as they provide a mechanism which        usually allows the mutex to be recovered after a child process        terminates abnormally while holding a mutex. If your system is POSIX compliant or if it implements the This is a mutex variant where a physical (lock-)file and the When multiple mutexes based on this mechanism are used within        multi-threaded, multi-process environments, deadlock errors (EDEADLK)        can be reported for valid mutex operations if This is similar to the This selects the ""best"" available file locking implementation,        choosing between Most mechanisms are only available on selected platforms, where the    underlying platform and With the file-based mechanisms It is best to The following table documents the names of mutexes used by httpd    and bundled modules.

Protocols," This directive specifies the list of protocols supported for a            server/virtual host. The list determines the allowed protocols            a client may negotiate for this server/host. You need to set protocols if you want to extend the available            protocols for a server/host. By default, only the http/1.1 protocol            (which includes the compatibility with 1.0 and 0.9 clients) is            allowed. For example, if you want to support HTTP/2 for a server with TLS,             specify: Valid protocols are It is safe to specify protocols that are unavailable/disabled. Such        protocol names will simply be ignored. Protocols specified in base servers are inherited for virtual hosts             only if the virtual host has no own Protocols directive.
