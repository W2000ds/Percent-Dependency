absolute_redirect,"If disabled, redirects issued by nginx will be relative.See also server_name_in_redirectand port_in_redirect directives."
aio,"Enables or disables the use of asynchronous file I/O (AIO)on FreeBSD and Linux:On FreeBSD, AIO can be used starting from FreeBSD\xc2\xa04.3.Prior to FreeBSD\xc2\xa011.0,AIO can either be linked statically into a kernel:or loaded dynamically as a kernel loadable module:On Linux, AIO can be used starting from kernel version 2.6.22.Also, it is necessary to enabledirectio,or otherwise reading will be blocking:On Linux,directiocan only be used for reading blocks that are aligned on 512-byteboundaries (or 4K for XFS).File\xe2\x80\x99s unaligned end is read in blocking mode.The same holds true for byte range requests and for FLV requestsnot from the beginning of a file: reading of unaligned data at thebeginning and end of a file will be blocking.When both AIO and sendfile are enabled on Linux,AIO is used for files that are larger than or equal tothe size specified in the directio directive,while sendfile is used for files of smaller sizesor when directio is disabled.Finally, files can be read and sentusing multi-threading (1.7.11),without blocking a worker process:Read and send file operations are offloaded to threads of the specifiedpool.If the pool name is omitted,the pool with the name \xe2\x80\x9cdefault\xe2\x80\x9d is used.The pool name can also be set with variables:By default, multi-threading is disabled, it should beenabled with the--with-threads configuration parameter.Currently, multi-threading is compatible only with theepoll,kqueue,andeventport methods.Multi-threaded sending of files is only supported on Linux.See also the sendfile directive."
aio_write,"If aio is enabled, specifies whether it is used for writing files.Currently, this only works when usingaio threadsand is limited to writing temporary fileswith data received from proxied servers."
alias,"Defines a replacement for the specified location.For example, with the following configurationon request of\xe2\x80\x9c/i/top.gif\xe2\x80\x9d, the file/data/w3/images/top.gif will be sent.The path value can contain variables,except $document_root and $realpath_root.If alias is used inside a location definedwith a regular expression then such regular expression shouldcontain captures and alias should refer tothese captures (0.7.40), for example:When location matches the last part of the directive\xe2\x80\x99s value:it is better to use therootdirective instead:"
auth_delay,"Delays processing of unauthorized requests with 401 response codeto prevent timing attacks when access is limited bypassword, by theresult of subrequest,or by JWT."
chunked_transfer_encoding,Allows disabling chunked transfer encoding in HTTP/1.1.It may come in handy when using a software failing to supportchunked encoding despite the standard\xe2\x80\x99s requirement.
client_body_buffer_size,"Sets buffer size for reading client request body.In case the request body is larger than the buffer,the whole body or only its part is written to atemporary file.By default, buffer size is equal to two memory pages.This is 8K on x86, other 32-bit platforms, and x86-64.It is usually 16K on other 64-bit platforms."
client_body_in_file_only,"Determines whether nginx should save the entire client request bodyinto a file.This directive can be used during debugging, or when using the$request_body_filevariable, or the$r->request_body_filemethod of the modulengx_http_perl_module.When set to the value on, temporary files are notremoved after request processing.The value clean will cause the temporary filesleft after request processing to be removed."
client_body_in_single_buffer,"Determines whether nginx should save the entire client request bodyin a single buffer.The directive is recommended when using the$request_bodyvariable, to save the number of copy operations involved."
client_body_temp_path,"Defines a directory for storing temporary files holding client request bodies.Up to three-level subdirectory hierarchy can be used under the specifieddirectory.For example, in the following configurationa path to a temporary file might look like this:"
client_body_timeout,"Defines a timeout for reading client request body.The timeout is set only for a period between two successive read operations,not for the transmission of the whole request body.If a client does not transmit anything within this time, therequest is terminated with the408 (Request Time-out)error."
client_header_buffer_size,"Sets buffer size for reading client request header.For most requests, a buffer of 1K bytes is enough.However, if a request includes long cookies, or comes from a WAP client,it may not fit into 1K.If a request line or a request header field does not fit intothis buffer then larger buffers, configured by thelarge_client_header_buffers directive,are allocated.If the directive is specified on the server level,the value from the default server can be used.Details are provided in the\xe2\x80\x9cVirtualserver selection\xe2\x80\x9d section."
client_header_timeout,"Defines a timeout for reading client request header.If a client does not transmit the entire header within this time, therequest is terminated with the408 (Request Time-out)error."
client_max_body_size,"Sets the maximum allowed size of the client request body.If the size in a request exceeds the configured value, the413 (Request Entity Too Large)error is returned to the client.Please be aware thatbrowsers cannot correctly displaythis error.Setting size to 0 disables checking of clientrequest body size."
connection_pool_size,"Allows accurate tuning of per-connection memory allocations.This directive has minimal impact on performanceand should not generally be used.By default, the size is equal to256 bytes on 32-bit platforms and 512 bytes on 64-bit platforms."
default_type,Defines the default MIME type of a response.Mapping of file name extensions to MIME types can be setwith the types directive.
directio,"Enables the use ofthe O_DIRECT flag (FreeBSD, Linux),the F_NOCACHE flag (macOS),or the directio() function (Solaris),when reading files that are larger than or equal tothe specified size.The directive automatically disables (0.7.15) the use ofsendfilefor a given request.It can be useful for serving large files:or when using aio on Linux."
directio_alignment,"Sets the alignment fordirectio.In most cases, a 512-byte alignment is enough.However, when using XFS under Linux, it needs to be increased to 4K."
disable_symlinks,"Determines how symbolic links should be treated when opening files:Example:This directive is only available on systems that have theopenat() and fstatat() interfaces.Such systems include modern versions of FreeBSD, Linux, and Solaris.Parameters on and if_not_owneradd a processing overhead."
error_page,"Defines the URI that will be shown for the specified errors.A uri value can contain variables.Example:This causes an internal redirect to the specified uriwith the client request method changed to \xe2\x80\x9cGET\xe2\x80\x9d(for all methods other than\xe2\x80\x9cGET\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHEAD\xe2\x80\x9d).Furthermore, it is possible to change the response code to anotherusing the \xe2\x80\x9c=response\xe2\x80\x9d syntax, for example:If an error response is processed by a proxied serveror a FastCGI/uwsgi/SCGI/gRPC server,and the server may return different response codes (e.g., 200, 302, 401or 404), it is possible to respond with the code it returns:If there is no need to change URI and method during internal redirectionit is possible to pass error processing into a named location:It is also possible to use URL redirects for error processing:In this case, by default, the response code 302 is returned to the client.It can only be changed to one of the redirect statuscodes (301, 302, 303, 307, and 308).These directives are inherited from the previous configuration levelif and only if there are no error_page directivesdefined on the current level."
etag,Enables or disables automatic generation of the \xe2\x80\x9cETag\xe2\x80\x9dresponse header field for static resources.
http,Provides the configuration file context in which the HTTP server directivesare specified.
if_modified_since,Specifies how to compare modification time of a responsewith the time in the\xe2\x80\x9cIf-Modified-Since\xe2\x80\x9drequest header field:
ignore_invalid_headers,"Controls whether header fields with invalid names should be ignored.Valid names are composed of English letters, digits, hyphens, and possiblyunderscores (as controlled by the underscores_in_headersdirective).If the directive is specified on the server level,the value from the default server can be used.Details are provided in the\xe2\x80\x9cVirtualserver selection\xe2\x80\x9d section."
internal,"Specifies that a given location can only be used for internal requests.For external requests, the client error404 (Not Found)is returned.Internal requests are the following:Example:"
keepalive_disable,"Disables keep-alive connections with misbehaving browsers.The browser parameters specify whichbrowsers will be affected.The value msie6 disables keep-alive connectionswith old versions of MSIE, once a POST request is received.The value safari disables keep-alive connectionswith Safari and Safari-like browsers on macOS and macOS-likeoperating systems.The value none enables keep-alive connectionswith all browsers."
keepalive_requests,"Sets the maximum number of requests that can beserved through one keep-alive connection.After the maximum number of requests are made, the connection is closed.Closing connections periodically is necessary to freeper-connection memory allocations.Therefore, using too high maximum number of requestscould result in excessive memory usage and not recommended."
keepalive_time,"Limits the maximum time during whichrequests can be processed through one keep-alive connection.After this time is reached, the connection is closedfollowing the subsequent request processing."
keepalive_timeout,The first parameter sets a timeout during which a keep-aliveclient connection will stay open on the server side.The zero value disables keep-alive client connections.The optional second parameter sets a value in the\xe2\x80\x9cKeep-Alive: timeout=time\xe2\x80\x9dresponse header field.Two parameters may differ.The\xe2\x80\x9cKeep-Alive: timeout=time\xe2\x80\x9dheader field is recognized by Mozilla and Konqueror.MSIE closes keep-alive connections by itself in about 60 seconds.
large_client_header_buffers,"Sets the maximum number and size ofbuffers used for reading large client request header.A request line cannot exceed the size of one buffer, or the414 (Request-URI Too Large)error is returned to the client.A request header field cannot exceed the size of one buffer as well, or the400 (Bad Request)error is returned to the client.Buffers are allocated only on demand.By default, the buffer size is equal to 8K bytes.If after the end of request processing a connection is transitionedinto the keep-alive state, these buffers are released.If the directive is specified on the server level,the value from the default server can be used.Details are provided in the\xe2\x80\x9cVirtualserver selection\xe2\x80\x9d section."
limit_except,"Limits allowed HTTP methods inside a location.The method parameter can be one of the following:GET,HEAD,POST,PUT,DELETE,MKCOL,COPY,MOVE,OPTIONS,PROPFIND,PROPPATCH,LOCK,UNLOCK,orPATCH.Allowing the GET method makes theHEAD method also allowed.Access to other methods can be limited using thengx_http_access_module,ngx_http_auth_basic_module,andngx_http_auth_jwt_module(1.13.10)modules directives:Please note that this will limit access to all methodsexcept GET and HEAD."
limit_rate,"Limits the rate of response transmission to a client.The rate is specified in bytes per second.The zero value disables rate limiting.The limit is set per a request, and so if a client simultaneously openstwo connections, the overall rate will be twice as muchas the specified limit.Parameter value can contain variables (1.17.0).It may be useful in cases where rate should be limiteddepending on a certain condition:Rate limit can also be set in the$limit_rate variable,however, since version 1.17.0, this method is not recommended:Rate limit can also be set in the\xe2\x80\x9cX-Accel-Limit-Rate\xe2\x80\x9d header field of a proxied server response.This capability can be disabled using theproxy_ignore_headers,fastcgi_ignore_headers,uwsgi_ignore_headers,andscgi_ignore_headersdirectives."
limit_rate_after,Sets the initial amount after which the further transmissionof a response to a client will be rate limited.Parameter value can contain variables (1.17.0).Example:
lingering_close,"Controls how nginx closes client connections.The default value \xe2\x80\x9con\xe2\x80\x9d instructs nginx towait for andprocess additional data from a clientbefore fully closing a connection, but onlyif heuristics suggests that a client may be sending more data.The value \xe2\x80\x9calways\xe2\x80\x9d will cause nginx to unconditionallywait for and process additional client data.The value \xe2\x80\x9coff\xe2\x80\x9d tells nginx to never wait formore data and close the connection immediately.This behavior breaks the protocol and should not be used under normalcircumstances.To control closingHTTP/2 connections,the directive must be specified on the server level (1.19.1)."
lingering_time,"When lingering_close is in effect,this directive specifies the maximum time during which nginxwill process (read and ignore) additional data coming from a client.After that, the connection will be closed, even if there will bemore data."
lingering_timeout,"When lingering_close is in effect, this directive specifiesthe maximum waiting time for more client data to arrive.If data are not received during this time, the connection is closed.Otherwise, the data are read and ignored, and nginx starts waitingfor more data again.The \xe2\x80\x9cwait-read-ignore\xe2\x80\x9d cycle is repeated, but no longer than specified by thelingering_time directive."
listen,"Sets the address and port for IP,or the path for a UNIX-domain socket on whichthe server will accept requests.Both address and port,or only address or only port can be specified.An address may also be a hostname, for example:IPv6 addresses (0.7.36) are specified in square brackets:UNIX-domain sockets (0.8.21) are specified with the \xe2\x80\x9cunix:\xe2\x80\x9dprefix:If only address is given, the port 80 is used.If the directive is not present then either *:80 is usedif nginx runs with the superuser privileges, or *:8000otherwise.The default_server parameter, if present,will cause the server to become the default server for the specifiedaddress:port pair.If none of the directives have the default_serverparameter then the first server with theaddress:port pair will bethe default server for this pair.The ssl parameter (0.7.14) allows specifying that allconnections accepted on this port should work in SSL mode.This allows for a more compact configuration for the server thathandles both HTTP and HTTPS requests.The http2 parameter (1.9.5) configures the port to acceptHTTP/2 connections.Normally, for this to work the ssl parameter should bespecified as well, but nginx can also be configured to accept HTTP/2connections without SSL.The quic parameter (1.25.0) configures the port to acceptQUIC connections.The proxy_protocol parameter (1.5.12)allows specifying that all connections accepted on this port should use thePROXYprotocol.The listen directivecan have several additional parameters specific to socket-related system calls.These parameters can be specified in anylisten directive, but only once for a givenaddress:port pair.Example:"
location,"Sets configuration depending on a request URI.The matching is performed against a normalized URI,after decoding the text encoded in the \xe2\x80\x9c%XX\xe2\x80\x9d form,resolving references to relative path components \xe2\x80\x9c.\xe2\x80\x9dand \xe2\x80\x9c..\xe2\x80\x9d, and possiblecompression of two or moreadjacent slashes into a single slash.A location can either be defined by a prefix string, or by a regular expression.Regular expressions are specified with the preceding\xe2\x80\x9c~*\xe2\x80\x9d modifier (for case-insensitive matching), or the\xe2\x80\x9c~\xe2\x80\x9d modifier (for case-sensitive matching).To find location matching a given request, nginx first checkslocations defined using the prefix strings (prefix locations).Among them, the location with the longest matchingprefix is selected and remembered.Then regular expressions are checked, in the order of their appearancein the configuration file.The search of regular expressions terminates on the first match,and the corresponding configuration is used.If no match with a regular expression is found then theconfiguration of the prefix location remembered earlier is used.location blocks can be nested, with some exceptionsmentioned below.For case-insensitive operating systems such as macOS and Cygwin,matching with prefix strings ignores a case (0.7.7).However, comparison is limited to one-byte locales.Regular expressions can contain captures (0.7.40) that can laterbe used in other directives.If the longest matching prefix location has the \xe2\x80\x9c^~\xe2\x80\x9d modifierthen regular expressions are not checked.Also, using the \xe2\x80\x9c=\xe2\x80\x9d modifier it is possible to definean exact match of URI and location.If an exact match is found, the search terminates.For example, if a \xe2\x80\x9c/\xe2\x80\x9d request happens frequently,defining \xe2\x80\x9clocation = /\xe2\x80\x9d will speed up the processingof these requests, as search terminates right after the firstcomparison.Such a location cannot obviously contain nested locations.Let\xe2\x80\x99s illustrate the above by an example:The \xe2\x80\x9c/\xe2\x80\x9d request will match configuration A,the \xe2\x80\x9c/index.html\xe2\x80\x9d request will match configuration B,the \xe2\x80\x9c/documents/document.html\xe2\x80\x9d request will matchconfiguration C,the \xe2\x80\x9c/images/1.gif\xe2\x80\x9d request will match configuration D, andthe \xe2\x80\x9c/documents/1.jpg\xe2\x80\x9d request will match configuration E.The \xe2\x80\x9c@\xe2\x80\x9d prefix defines a named location.Such a location is not used for a regular request processing, but insteadused for request redirection.They cannot be nested, and cannot contain nested locations.If a location is defined by a prefix string that ends with the slash character,and requests are processed by one ofproxy_pass,fastcgi_pass,uwsgi_pass,scgi_pass,memcached_pass, orgrpc_pass,then the special processing is performed.In response to a request with URI equal to this string,but without the trailing slash,a permanent redirect with the code 301 will be returned to the requested URIwith the slash appended.If this is not desired, an exact match of the URI and location could bedefined like this:"
log_not_found,Enables or disables logging of errors about not found files intoerror_log.
log_subrequest,Enables or disables logging of subrequests intoaccess_log.
max_ranges,"Limits the maximum allowed number of ranges in byte-range requests.Requests that exceed the limit are processed as if there were nobyte ranges specified.By default, the number of ranges is not limited.The zero value disables the byte-range support completely."
merge_slashes,"Enables or disables compression of two or more adjacent slashesin a URI into a single slash.Note that compression is essential for the correct matching of prefix stringand regular expression locations.Without it, the \xe2\x80\x9c//scripts/one.php\xe2\x80\x9d request would not matchand might be processed as a static file.So it gets converted to \xe2\x80\x9c/scripts/one.php\xe2\x80\x9d.Turning the compression off can become necessary if a URIcontains base64-encoded names, since base64 uses the \xe2\x80\x9c/\xe2\x80\x9dcharacter internally.However, for security considerations, it is better to avoid turningthe compression off.If the directive is specified on the server level,the value from the default server can be used.Details are provided in the\xe2\x80\x9cVirtualserver selection\xe2\x80\x9d section."
msie_padding,Enables or disables adding comments to responses for MSIE clients with statusgreater than 400 to increase the response size to 512 bytes.
msie_refresh,Enables or disables issuing refreshes instead of redirects for MSIE clients.
open_file_cache,Configures a cache that can store:The directive has the following parameters:Example:
open_file_cache_errors,Enables or disables caching of file lookup errors byopen_file_cache.
open_file_cache_min_uses,"Sets the minimum number of file accesses duringthe period configured by the inactive parameterof the open_file_cache directive, required for a filedescriptor to remain open in the cache."
open_file_cache_valid,Sets a time after whichopen_file_cacheelements should be validated.
output_buffers,Sets the number and size of thebuffers used for reading a response from a disk.
port_in_redirect,Enables or disables specifying the port inabsolute redirects issued by nginx.The use of the primary server name in redirects is controlled bythe server_name_in_redirect directive.
postpone_output,"If possible, the transmission of client data will be postponed untilnginx has at least size bytes of data to send.The zero value disables postponing data transmission."
read_ahead,"Sets the amount of pre-reading for the kernel when working with file.On Linux, theposix_fadvise(0, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL)system call is used, and so the size parameter is ignored.On FreeBSD, thefcntl(O_READAHEAD,size)system call, supported since FreeBSD\xc2\xa09.0-CURRENT, is used.FreeBSD\xc2\xa07 has to bepatched."
recursive_error_pages,Enables or disables doing several redirects using theerror_pagedirective.The number of such redirects is limited.
request_pool_size,Allows accurate tuning of per-request memory allocations.This directive has minimal impact on performanceand should not generally be used.
reset_timedout_connection,"Enables or disables resetting timed out connectionsand connectionsclosedwith the non-standard code 444 (1.15.2).The reset is performed as follows.Before closing a socket, theSO_LINGERoption is set on it with a timeout value of 0.When the socket is closed, TCP RST is sent to the client, and all memoryoccupied by this socket is released.This helps avoid keeping an already closed socket with filled buffersin a FIN_WAIT1 state for a long time.It should be noted that timed out keep-alive connections areclosed normally."
resolver,"Configures name servers used to resolve names of upstream serversinto addresses, for example:The address can be specified as a domain name or IP address,with an optional port (1.3.1, 1.2.2).If port is not specified, the port 53 is used.Name servers are queried in a round-robin fashion.By default, nginx will look up both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses while resolving.If looking up of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses is not desired,the ipv4=off (1.23.1) orthe ipv6=off parameter can be specified.By default, nginx caches answers using the TTL value of a response.An optional valid parameter allows overriding it:The optional status_zone parameter (1.17.1)enablescollectionof DNS server statistics of requests and responsesin the specified zone.The parameter is available as part of ourcommercial subscription."
resolver_timeout,"Sets a timeout for name resolution, for example:"
root,"Sets the root directory for requests.For example, with the following configurationThe /data/w3/i/top.gif file will be sent in response tothe \xe2\x80\x9c/i/top.gif\xe2\x80\x9d request.The path value can contain variables,except $document_root and $realpath_root.A path to the file is constructed by merely adding a URI to the valueof the root directive.If a URI has to be modified, thealias directive should be used."
satisfy,"Allows access if all (all) or at least one(any) of thengx_http_access_module,ngx_http_auth_basic_module,ngx_http_auth_request_module,orngx_http_auth_jwt_modulemodules allow access.Example:"
send_lowat,"If the directive is set to a non-zero value, nginx will try to minimizethe number of send operations on client sockets by using eitherNOTE_LOWAT flag of thekqueue methodor the SO_SNDLOWAT socket option.In both cases the specified size is used.This directive is ignored on Linux, Solaris, and Windows."
send_timeout,"Sets a timeout for transmitting a response to the client.The timeout is set only between two successive write operations,not for the transmission of the whole response.If the client does not receive anything within this time,the connection is closed."
sendfile,"Enables or disables the use ofsendfile().Starting from nginx\xc2\xa00.8.12 and FreeBSD\xc2\xa05.2.1,aio can be used to pre-load datafor sendfile():In this configuration, sendfile() is called withthe SF_NODISKIO flag which causes it not to block on disk I/O,but, instead, report back that the data are not in memory.nginx then initiates an asynchronous data load by reading one byte.On the first read, the FreeBSD kernel loads the first 128K bytesof a file into memory, although next reads will only load data in 16K chunks.This can be changed using theread_ahead directive."
sendfile_max_chunk,"Limits the amount of data that can betransferred in a single sendfile() call.Without the limit, one fast connection may seize the worker process entirely."
server,"Sets configuration for a virtual server.There is no clear separation between IP-based (based on the IP address)and name-based (based on the \xe2\x80\x9cHost\xe2\x80\x9d request header field)virtual servers.Instead, the listen directives describe alladdresses and ports that should accept connections for the server, and theserver_name directive lists all server names.Example configurations are provided in the\xe2\x80\x9cHow nginx processes a request\xe2\x80\x9d document."
server_name,"Sets names of a virtual server, for example:The first name becomes the primary server name.Server names can include an asterisk (\xe2\x80\x9c*\xe2\x80\x9d)replacing the first or last part of a name:Such names are called wildcard names.The first two of the names mentioned above can be combined in one:It is also possible to use regular expressions in server names,preceding the name with a tilde (\xe2\x80\x9c~\xe2\x80\x9d):Regular expressions can contain captures (0.7.40) that can laterbe used in other directives:Named captures in regular expressions create variables (0.8.25)that can later be used in other directives:If the directive\xe2\x80\x99s parameter is set to \xe2\x80\x9c$hostname\xe2\x80\x9d (0.9.4), themachine\xe2\x80\x99s hostname is inserted.It is also possible to specify an empty server name (0.7.11):It allows this server to process requests without the \xe2\x80\x9cHost\xe2\x80\x9dheader field\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 instead of the default server\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 for the given address:port pair.This is the default setting.During searching for a virtual server by name,if the name matches more than one of the specified variants,(e.g. both a wildcard name and regular expression match), the first matchingvariant will be chosen, in the following order of priority:Detailed description of server names is provided in a separateServer names document."
server_name_in_redirect,"Enables or disables the use of the primary server name, specified by theserver_name directive,in absolute redirects issued by nginx.When the use of the primary server name is disabled, the name from the\xe2\x80\x9cHost\xe2\x80\x9d request header field is used.If this field is not present, the IP address of the server is used.The use of a port in redirects is controlled bythe port_in_redirect directive."
server_names_hash_bucket_size,Sets the bucket size for the server names hash tables.The default value depends on the size of the processor\xe2\x80\x99s cache line.The details of setting up hash tables are provided in a separatedocument.
server_names_hash_max_size,Sets the maximum size of the server names hash tables.The details of setting up hash tables are provided in a separatedocument.
server_tokens,"Enables or disables emitting nginx version on error pages and in the\xe2\x80\x9cServer\xe2\x80\x9d response header field.The build parameter (1.11.10) enables emittinga build namealong with nginx version.Additionally, as part of ourcommercial subscription,starting from version 1.9.13the signature on error pages andthe \xe2\x80\x9cServer\xe2\x80\x9d response header field valuecan be set explicitly using the string with variables.An empty string disables the emission of the \xe2\x80\x9cServer\xe2\x80\x9d field."
subrequest_output_buffer_size,"Sets the size of the buffer used forstoring the response body of a subrequest.By default, the buffer size is equal to one memory page.This is either 4K or 8K, depending on a platform.It can be made smaller, however.The directive is applicable only for subrequestswith response bodies saved into memory.For example, such subrequests are created bySSI."
tcp_nodelay,"Enables or disables the use of the TCP_NODELAY option.The option is enabled when a connection is transitioned into thekeep-alive state.Additionally, it is enabled on SSL connections,for unbuffered proxying,and for WebSocket proxying."
tcp_nopush,Enables or disables the use ofthe TCP_NOPUSH socket option on FreeBSDor the TCP_CORK socket option on Linux.The options are enabled only when sendfile is used.Enabling the option allows
try_files,"Checks the existence of files in the specified order and usesthe first found file for request processing; the processingis performed in the current context.The path to a file is constructed from thefile parameteraccording to theroot and alias directives.It is possible to check directory\xe2\x80\x99s existence by specifyinga slash at the end of a name, e.g. \xe2\x80\x9c$uri/\xe2\x80\x9d.If none of the files were found, an internal redirect to theuri specified in the last parameter is made.For example:The last parameter can also point to a named location,as shown in examples below.Starting from version 0.7.51, the last parameter can also be acode:Example in proxying Mongrel:Example for Drupal/FastCGI:In the following example,the try_files directive is equivalent toAnd here,try_files checks the existence of the PHP filebefore passing the request to the FastCGI server.Example for Wordpress and Joomla:"
types,"Maps file name extensions to MIME types of responses.Extensions are case-insensitive.Several extensions can be mapped to one type, for example:A sufficiently full mapping table is distributed with nginx in theconf/mime.types file.To make a particular location emit the\xe2\x80\x9capplication/octet-stream\xe2\x80\x9dMIME type for all requests, the following configuration can be used:"
types_hash_bucket_size,Sets the bucket size for the types hash tables.The details of setting up hash tables are provided in a separatedocument.
types_hash_max_size,Sets the maximum size of the types hash tables.The details of setting up hash tables are provided in a separatedocument.
